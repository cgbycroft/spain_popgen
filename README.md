Feel free to use these scripts for academic or personal use.  These are based on work for Clare's PhD thesis, and subsequent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08272-w) of a study in Spanish genetic population structure. 

DISCLAIMER: Scripts may contain hard-coded directories, or will try to load files that you don't have access to. I recommend copy-pasting sections of scripts where required for your own code.
